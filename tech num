when an even digit number is divided into exactly two parts and the square
value of the sum of those two numbers is equal to the original number
3025=(30+25)^2
n = 3025
m = str(n)
a = m[:len(m)//2]
b = m[len(m)//2:]
c = int(a) + int(b)
d = c**2
if d == n:
print("Tech number")
else:
print("Not a Tech number")
